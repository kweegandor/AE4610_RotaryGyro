# Project Guideline

{% hint style="danger" %}
THIS IS SPRING 2022 GUIDELINE : NEED UPDATE
{% endhint %}

This is an **open project** where you need to use your knowledge in the control theory to apply in the real world or simulation environment.

&#x20;

**Team or Individual**: You can either form a team with maximum of 3 members or work on your own.

&#x20;

**\*Project Proposal:** Once you have decided to form a group or do on your own, submit the proposal for your project on canvas. This should include team memberâ€™s name or your name, project idea, and the software or hardware you will use. **Due TBD on Gradescope**. If you submit earlier, we will give feedback as soon as possible.

&#x20;

**Grading Criteria:**

1\.      Introduction (10 points): background information about the project, materials/program used, any foundation equations, brief introduction of the project,

2\.      Methods (30 points): controllers used, how it was implemented, vary the controller and show the result (example of worst cases and optimal case), how better performance can be obtained,

3\.      Results (20 points): discussion on the results with plots, and tables etc.

4\.      Conclusion (10 points): anything that you have learnt throughout the project

5\.      Reference (5 points): proper format (AIAA)

6\.      Peer review (10 points): For individual you will get 10 points, for groups, you will submit peer review.

&#x20;

**Suggestions:**

1\.      Use Simulink/MATLAB to model a control system

A.      Lots of example available online (self-balancing robot, double inverted-pendulum, ball balancing model etc).

2\.      Use Robotarium to simulate and run in the real world

A.      This requires you to register with [https://www.robotarium.gatech.edu/](https://www.robotarium.gatech.edu/) to run in the Robotarium itself. So, if you are trying to use Robotarium register as soon as possible. If you are just using the simulation you can just download the simulator  [here (Matlab)](https://github.com/robotarium/robotarium-matlab-simulator) or [here (Python)](https://github.com/robotarium/robotarium\_python\_simulator).

3\.      Use Webot to simulate robots

A.      [https://cyberbotics.com/#cyberbotics](https://cyberbotics.com/#cyberbotics) to download the program

B.      You can find some examples in the following [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC079LdtMagG9FEY6Sddgq5A) channel

C.      You may do line-following robot (with IR sensor), wall following robot (proximity sensor or lidar sensor), inverted pendulum/self-balancing robot.

4\.      Use Arduino or real physical model to implement control theory.&#x20;

**Submission:** Write a report and submit pdf **Due: TBD on Gradescope**
